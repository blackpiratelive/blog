I have been using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.orh) with [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). Initially I started using because of the cool animation it has. And I have stayed with Hyprland since.  

## Look and Feel
Hyprland excels at it. Animations are super smooth. The default look is actually pretty good. I didn't have to do much ricing to get it look decent enough. 

## Configuration
Configuration was easy. I haven't _really_ configured any tiling window manager previously, so it was bit hard for me.  But with Google search I was easily able to pull it off. I didn't change much. Only changed DPI, added few keybindings. 

## Documentation
Documentation for Hyprland is okay. It's not bad, but also nowhere as good as Arch Linux documentation. Basic stuff was easy to understand, but for little bit niche stuff I was having a tough time. Maybe it's just me being dumb. I only read the surface level stuff so not totally sure how good the documentation is for more advanced stuff. Since it is not that much old, I hope it would only get better with time. 

## Waybar
This is where I faced the main problem. everything worked but I was unable to show the numbering of workspaces at first. Documentation is super confusing for me. Then I saw some dotfiles and was able to make my waybar show the workspace number. After that ricing it was easy. I still haven't added any new command. Just the default ones.

## Wallpaper
I used hyprpaper for wallpapers. It is minimal, as you need to change the config to change the wallpaper. But I do not like it. I am someone who likes to change wallpaper quite often, and being able to change wallpaper while seeing them is what I am used to. I miss nitrogen. I should write shell script to achieve it.

## Terminal
Right now I am using foot as my main terminal. I heard it can show images from [Bugswriter's](https://bugswriter.com) video, and installed it myself. I configured it show it can show previews and images in lf file manager. It wasn't easy, but I was able to do it. I am going to stick with this terminal, unless there is a reason to switch.

## Other things
I didn't have any problems with wayland. Although I had to relearn a few things. For example I cannot figure out how to change brightness of the monitor of my laptop. Finally now I use ``brill`` command to change the brightness. Syntax of brill is little bit too much complicated. I should make it a keybinding. Also why is it that if I lower my brightness too much it would completely shut down the monitor backlight? And then I won't be able to see anything to even revert back.
Audio also gave me some pain. Maybe it was my fault, as I installed other DE which came with their own audio system. But right now I have it working properly and my keyboard buttons also work. 

## Conclusion
Hyprland is the very first window manager that I installed from scratch and configured it myself. So it was definitely easy to install and configure. Came for the animations, staying for total experience.

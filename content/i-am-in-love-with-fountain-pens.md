I like pens. If you ask my family they would tell you how much money I have spent (ahem, wasted) on pens. I used almost all type of pens there is, that is if they are available for purchase in India. 
My recent obsession is fountain pens. I love them. A good fountain pen writes miles better than any other kind of pen. But they are expensive. Like very expensive. But most the fountain pens are made so that they can be used for a very long time. I bought some with my own money and some from parents. 
Another benifit of using fountain pens is that a wide collection of inks, in color and in quality both. Right now I have 3 black inks one blue turquiose and one green shamrock. I mainly use black, as it is work appropriate and black probably looks the best on white paper.  
## List of the pens I own:
### Parker Vector
It is the first true fountain pen that I used. Actually my brother bought and I borrowed from him to use it. The nib is definitely scratchy and the converter doesn't keep much ink. Other than that it looks good and feels lightweight. The grip is smooth, so it's prone to slip if you have a sweaty or oily hand. It's overall a meh pen. There's better alternative at this price point. 

### Jinhao 992 Fine
This is my 2nd least favourite pen. Don't get me wrong, it's a good pen, but the nib is too scratchy for my taste (I have been spoiled by smoother nib). The pen has a transparent body, that means it's a demonstrator pen. The grip is smooth but much better than Parker Vector. The converter is big, also you can use this pen as eyedropper. If you can get over the scratchy feeing of the nib it's definitely gonna be one of the best. 

### Jinhao x450 Medium
This pen is heaviest in my collection. It took me quite some time to be able to use it comfortably. But for long form writing I do not use it. Most of the time I use this pen without keeping the cap posted. This pen has the thickest line and can actually produce some noticeable shading with appropriate ink. By the looks, it's definitely one of the best looking. Only problem I have with this pen is while disassembling. I tried so many times, so many way and still not be able to remove
the nib from the main body. I gave up. 

### Platinum Preppy Fine
This is my 2nd favourite pen. This is arugbly one of the smoothest nib in my collection, despite being a fine nib. The weight is little bit on the lighter side, which I do not like, but I am sure that filling up the whole pen with ink (as eyedropper) will significantly increase the weight of the pen that would make me want to write with it. I'll try it. 


If you are planning to try a fountain pen, my recommend would be to go with Platinum Preppy. Although I do not like the argonomics, the very little weight and smoothest nib makes up for that. Also platinum pens can stay over a year without drying, if you keep them capped.

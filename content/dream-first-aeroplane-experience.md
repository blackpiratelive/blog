> I dreamt this after drinking coffee. 


I had my first experience of riding  an aeroplane.  It was riding very low and the windows were not glass.  It was like a toy and it was fun. 

Then in train Pabitra had a bhai who was not found. He said his brother came with us but he was not sure if actially. He said that he would say that he is dead and instructed us to make a fake dead body to show in case. I once heard someone crying and calling "dada" but cannot figure out from where and who it was. Trying to find, we found the snake. The snake was scaring an animal which was neither dog not a cat, rather a mixture of two. There was a snake in the train. Actually two. Some people caught it. I also hold it in my hands and didn't let it bite me.. 
At the final dream I don't remember its fraustating, 
I woke after the 2nd sleep, thought about writing down and repeated in my mind what I dreamt then slept and saw the third dream. Maybe because of repeatation I was able to remember. 
I took coffee just before sleep.
